### Test Data
The testData directory contains the test files which I have used for testing this applicaton.
#### Testing
- First input some data using the index api
- Now search for some word using the search api
- Clear api will help you to clear all the data stored 

### Vision
We can use this application anywhere we have to search for some text containing some words like 
- in a blogging site that will use words to search for top blogs or 
- in email to get top 10 emails with that particular word or news or
- I can make my own search engine using this.
